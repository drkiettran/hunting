== Threat Identification & Detection Creation ==
TI -> T3 : Report new adversary TTP
note right : New threat intelligence\nfrom multiple sources
T3 -> T3 : Analyze threat patterns
T3 -> Elastic : Create detection analytic
T3 -> Databricks : Create detection analytic
note right : Analytics created based\non observed behaviors

== Continuous Monitoring & Detection ==
loop Continuous Monitoring
    Elastic -> Elastic : Run automated detection\non visibility data
    Databricks -> Databricks : Run automated detection\non visibility data
    
    alt Detection Triggered
        Elastic -> SIEM : Send detection alert
        Databricks -> SIEM : Send detection alert
        SIEM -> SIEM : Aggregate & triage alerts
        
        alt Critical Threshold Met
            SIEM -> SN : Auto-create critical ticket
            activate SN
            SN -> T1 : Notify of critical alert
        else Normal Alert
            SIEM -> T1 : Display in dashboard
        end
    end
end

== Tier 1 Investigation ==
activate T1
T1 -> SN : Create/Update ticket
T1 -> Elastic : Investigate event details
T1 -> Elastic : Pivot across datasets
T1 -> SN : Document findings in ticket

alt Requires Escalation
    T1 -> SN : Assign ticket to Tier 2
    T1 -> T2 : Notify of escalation
    deactivate T1
else Investigation Complete
    T1 -> SN : Close ticket
    deactivate T1
end

== Tier 2 Deep Analysis ==
activate T2
T2 -> SN : Receive ticket notification
T2 -> Databricks : Access full records
T2 -> Databricks : Develop analysis notebooks
T2 -> Elastic : Create investigation queries

deactivate T2

== System Cleanup ==
SN -> SN : Update case workflow status
deactivate SN

' Notes
note over TI, KB : This sequence represents one complete cycle\nof the Persistent Hunt workflow
note over Elastic, Databricks : Continuous monitoring runs\nindependently of investigations
note over T1, T2 : Analysts can escalate or close\nbased on investigation findings
